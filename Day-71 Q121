Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    char name[50];
    int age;

    fp = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error creating file");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);

    printf("Enter age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    fprintf(fp, "Name: %sAge: %d\n", name, age);
    fclose(fp);

    printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt");
    return 0;
}
